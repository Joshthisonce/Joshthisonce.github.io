          <h3 class="text-center">Geralt of Rivia</h3>
          <p>
            At a young age Geralt was given to the witchers of the Wolf School to be trained in their ways and mutated. It was at Kaer Morhen where he received his training and changes, in time he went on to go through the Trial of Grasses, as all witchers must. Due to how exceptionally he did during the trial he went on to be put through further mutations along with others, though Geralt was the only one to survive. This turned his hair white giving him one of his most recognizable features. After spending his remaining time at the fortress continuing to progress, he left atop his horse Roach to wander the land and become a monster slayer for hire. One of his first acts was due to circumstance, he stumbled across bandits raping a young girl while beating her father. Geralt approached killing one of the bandits mercilessly and hoped to be given thanks by their victims, however the father fled with the bandits in terror as the girl fainted in fear of him.
            <br/><br/>
            This prompted Geralt to stop trying to pretend to be a knight or noble man on a quest to save others, sending him on the path of being a cold emotionless witcher like so many others. Another famous task of his was the curing of Foltest's Daughter, Adda, of the Striga curse. This resulted in him going through a grueling battle against the creature and nearly dying due to a serious neck injury, yet Geralt managed the task in the end. He was rewarded greatly and while he may not have realized it at the time this established his foothold in Temeria, which would shape his life greatly. Another important event in his life was his dealing with a group of people in Blaviken, they were a threat to the people of the settlement. Geralt knew of their danger and slew them all violently to protect the town from them, however to the people it appeared as if he just randomly killed otherwise innocent people. This earned him the alias "The Butcher of Blaviken" which haunts him still.
            <br/><br/>
            Through his adventures Geralt met with many interesting figures, one such was the poet Dandelion whom which formed a friendship with him. They have twice visited a place known as The Edge of The World where both times they found themselves mixed in with serious groups and events. As well he was hired by the Queen of Cintra, Calanthe. In her service he ended up seeing the resolution of one path of destiny while opening up another. While dealing with the effects of a Genie upon Dandelion, Geralt ended up in Rinde where he met the Sorceress Yennefer, it was then that they first started to fall in love.

          <h3 class="text-center">Triss Merigold</h3>
          <p>
            Triss Merigold of Maribor is a sorceress and known as the "Fourteenth of the Hill" because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill. She is friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but is also in love with the latter. Triss took care of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and is like an older sister to her. It was through her intervention that Ciri was not inadvertently given harmful elixirs as the witchers were planning on subjecting her to the Trial of the Grasses as a last resort in an attempt to control Ciri's growing magical power. This would have either killed Ciri or made her a mutant, meaning she would become barren and unable to bear children like every other sterile witcher.
            <br/><br/>
            Triss was a member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses.
            She is a skilled healer and carries with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on herself because ironically, she is allergic to potions. She is also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counts most. She wears an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.

          <h3 class="text-center">Shani</h3>
          <p>
            Shani is a red-haired medic, and a student at the Academy of Oxenfurt. While still a student, she, Dandelion, and Philippa Eilhart helped Geralt chase down Rience. She participated in the Battle of Brenna as part of the staff of Milo "Rusty" Vanderbeck's field hospital. A friend of Dandelion and Geralt. Many years after the Witcher saga, she became the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Herbology of the University of Oxenfurt.

          <h3 class="text-center">Zoltan Chivay</h3>
          <p>
            Zoltan Chivay is a dwarf, veteran of the Second Nilfgaard War, and a friend of Geralt. They first met when Geralt and his party were going towards the Yaruga river from Brokilon, but the dwarf advised them to join his company and go eastwards. It is from Zoltan that Geralt got his sword — Sihil.
            He also had a talking parrot, Field Marshal Windbag, which he sold to the gnome Percival Schuttenbach when he started a jeweler's workshop in Novigrad.
